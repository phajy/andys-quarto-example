## Parallel-transport and geodesics

![Parallel transport of a vector $\vec{v}(\lambda)$ where $\lambda$ is an affine parameter. For geodesics the vector $\vec{v}$ is a tangent vector, $\vec{u}(\lambda)$.](parallel_transport.png){.invert-dark width=300 #fig-parallel-transport fig-alt="A line parametrized by lambda with a vector v(lambda) at each point along the line. The vector is shown to be parallel-transported along the line."}

We can use the idea of parallel transport to construct *geodesics*, defined as curves that parallel-transport their own tangent vectors. That is, for a geodesic

$$
\nabla_{\vec u} {\vec u} = 0
$$

$$
\text{i.e.} \qquad u^\beta {u^\alpha}_{;\beta} = 0
$$

$$
\text{i.e.} \qquad u^\beta {u^\alpha}_{,\beta} + {\Gamma^\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} u^\beta u^\gamma = 0 \\
$$

$$
\frac{d}{d\lambda} \left( \frac{d x^\alpha}{d\lambda}
        \right) + {\Gamma^\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} \frac{d x^\beta}{d\lambda} \frac{d
        x^\gamma}{d\lambda} = 0
$$ {#eq-geodesic}

where in the last of these expressions (often called the *geodesic equation*, though the first is also the geodesic equation), $\lambda$ is a continuous parameter along the curve.

We have some freedom to choose $\lambda$ -- if we choose it to be the proper time of a particle with the curve as its world line, then $\vec{u}$ is the velocity of the particle. However, $\lambda$ is a more general quantity and can be used also for light rays with no proper time. Any linear transformation of $\lambda$, such as $\phi = a \lambda + b$ with $a$, $b$ constants, has $\vec{x}(\phi)$ a valid solution of the geodesic equation (try the transformation $\lambda \to \phi$) -- we refer to $\lambda$ (or $\phi$) as an **affine parameter**.

In a locally-flat region, where the Christoffel symbols vanish, clearly the geodesic equation (@eq-geodesic) reduces to

$$
\frac{d^2 x^\alpha}{d\lambda^2} = 0
$$

which solves to the straight-line solution

$$
x^\alpha = A^\alpha \lambda + B^\alpha. 
$$

In fact we can say, in a very real sense, that all geodesics are **straight**. This definition about "parallel transport of the tangent vector" is the only sensible definition of a straight line -- it means that the curve at each point keeps moving in the direction of its local tangent vector. No other frame-independent definition of "straight" makes sense.
