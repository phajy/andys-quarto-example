For geodesics the vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is a tangent vector, \\(\\vec{u}(\\lambda)\\).\n\n\n\nWe can use the idea of parallel transport to construct geodesics, defined as curves that parallel-transport their own tangent vectors. That is, for a geodesic\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\pmb{\\nabla}_{\\vec u} {\\vec u} &= 0 \\\\\n    \\text{i.e.} \\qquad u^\\beta {u^\\alpha}_{;\\beta} &= 0 \\\\\n    \\text{i.e.} \\qquad u^\\beta {u^\\alpha}_{,\\beta} +\n        {\\Gamma^\\alpha}_{\\beta\\gamma} u^\\beta u^\\gamma &= 0 \\\\\n    \\text{or} \\qquad \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{d x^\\alpha}{d\\lambda}\n        \\right) + {\\Gamma^\\alpha}_{\\beta\\gamma} \\frac{d x^\\beta}{d\\lambda} \\frac{d\n        x^\\gamma}{d\\lambda} &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere in the last of these expressions (often called the geodesic equation, though the first is also the geodesic equation), \\(\\lambda\\) is a continuous parameter along the curve.\nWe have some freedom to choose \\(\\lambda\\) – if we choose it to be the proper time of a particle with the curve as its world line, then \\(\\vec{u}\\) is the velocity of the particle. However, \\(\\lambda\\) is a more general quantity and can be used also for light rays with no proper time. Any linear transformation of \\(\\lambda\\), such as \\(\\phi = a \\lambda + b\\) with \\(a\\), \\(b\\) constants, has \\(\\vec{x}(\\phi)\\) a valid solution of the geodesic equation (try the transformation \\(\\lambda \\to \\phi\\)) – we refer to \\(\\lambda\\) (or \\(\\phi\\)) as an affine parameter.\nIn a locally-flat region, where the Christoffel symbols vanish, clearly the geodesic equation reduces to\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 x^\\alpha}{d\\lambda^2} = 0\n\\]\nwhich solves to the straight-line solution\n\\[\nx^\\alpha = A^\\alpha \\lambda + B^\\alpha.\n\\]\nIn fact we can say, in a very real sense, that all geodesics are straight. This definition about “parallel transport of the tangent vector” is the only sensible definition of a straight line – it means that the curve at each point keeps moving in the direction of its local tangent vector. No other frame-independent definition of “straight” makes sense."
